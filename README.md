# bayesian-PValue-Prediction-Intervals
This repository provides a friendly way of computing the P-value Prediction Interval for future P-values given an observed P-value according to the article, "Assessment of P-value variability in the current replicability crisis" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01664).
